# Sort Analysis Data

## Results Table
Make sure to go out to at least 100,000 (more are welcome), and you have 10 different values (more welcome). You are welcome to go farther, but given 100,000 can take about 20 seconds on a fast desktop computer, and 200,000 took 77 seconds, you start having to wait much longer the more 0s you add. However, to build a clearer line, you will want more data points. 

You are free to write a script to run the program and build your table (then copy that table built into the markdown). If you do that, please include the script into the repo.

## BigO Analysis  / Questions

### 1. Build a line chart
Build a line chart using your favorite program. Your X axis will be N increasing, and your Y access will be the numbers for each type of sort. This will create something similar to the graph in the instructions, though it won't be as smooth.

Include the image in your markdown. As a reminder, you save the image in your repo, and use [image markdown].





### 2. Convinced?
Given the direction of the line chart, are you "convinced" of the complexity of each of the sorts? Why or why not?


### 3. Big O
Build another table that presents the best, worst, and average case for Bubble, Selection, and Insertion. You are free to use resources for this, but please reference them if you do.
